# Final Project Remake

This repository contains a remake of my final assignments from the **Programming Techniques** course (Kỹ thuật lập trình - KTLT), focusing on code clarity and structure.

- ✅ **Improved structure & readability**
- 🔄 **Rewritten for better understanding and maintainability**
- 🛠️ **Clean, modular, and well-commented code**

This is a refined version of my original final-term exercises, recreated with the goal of learning and applying better coding practices.
